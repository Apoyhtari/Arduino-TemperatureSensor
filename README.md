# saturn-commandCenter

Saturn is simple application which brings all your favorite web applications in to one. 

Have you ever run into a problem that you have multiple tabs open in your browser just for different media outlets? I sure have.
With saturn-commandCenter you can configure your messengers like whatsapp and telegram and your favorite social media sites into one view.

Saturn-commandCenter let's you configure your feeds and disable the ones you don't want to see. 

However this project is still at the starting point and will change over time a lot. Right now it has configuration and basic feed implemented with a simple server and arduino temperature sensor code.


##Future features:

Dashboard like software for all your home needs. for example social media feeds and news feeds which are configurable.
frontend for the measurements including graphs etc.

more sensor data for different measurements.

Fully configurable. 

notifications and link support. 

##TODO: 
Bundle backend with frontend to a single application.
styling and UI fine tunings.
improve loading times of views now they are painfully slow
messaging apps in the background + notifications
