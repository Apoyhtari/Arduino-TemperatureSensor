# Arduino-TemperatureSensor

Simple server for reading temperatures from arduino and then putting them into a database.

Future features:

Dashboard like software for all your home needs. for example social media feeds and news feeds which are configurable.
frontend for the measurements including graphs etc.
more sensor data for different measurements.

TODO: 
Scope has changed a bit, should rename repository appropriately.
styling and UI fine tunings.
